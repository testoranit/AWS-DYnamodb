with advent of big data
u need nosqldb
fully managed cloud db
Seamless on-demand scaling
Unlimited COncurrent Read/write
Single digit millisecond latency
SUb-microsecond latency with DAX

Demo ENv Setup
1)setup AWS API user
IAM
Aws console not required only programmatic access-->Adminaccess,Dynamodbfull access-->save cred
windows on local-->env varibales-->+ varibale-->for acces ke id and key value and region
install nodejs on windows on cme node --version
browser nodejs from browser LTS
node --version
got to vscode the zip file pat u downloaded test.zip
terminal-->npm install aws-sdk
node list-table.js


Data Normalization
why :- to efficeintly organize data,eliminate redundant data

Normilization forms
1)1NF:- elimante repeating groups
2)2NF:- elimante redundant data,
3)3NF:-elimate columns that are not dependent on kry

Also this leads to more able creation and since more table created more operations and more compute power is required,so rdbms db doesn't solve this issue if data is huge
so Nosql db.

AS rdbms db:- not suited for unstrucutred data and big data

**Basics of Nosql db

Dynamodb(Serverless,Nosql,0-adminstration,u don't need any instalaalltion,strat using directly)
Items(row) attribut(columns)
in json format
Primke is comluslory
has local sec index
global sec index

tables are top level entities
use some prefix to nam tables

Data types
Scalar:- string,number,boolean,binary (exactly one value)
set typles:- multiple scalar values (string set,number set,binary set, repated value not allowed in set)
Document typez:_list and map(complex structure)
Dynamo db charges on RCU and WCU

RCU:- 4KB of data 1 RCU, 1 strong read consitency
WCU:- 1KB of data 1 WCU, ! write per second

DYnamo db stores data in partitions
1 partition=10gb o data
1 partiton=1000wcu or 3000rcu
table can have 1 or more partitions

when u create a table it will provison partiton based on provisone capacity
eg:- 500 RCU's and 500 wcu

number of partitons=(500 rcu/3000 + 500/1000wcu)=0.67 which is 1 Pariton
if run out of memory it will allocate more part

Index:_
1 Mand prim key=either simple or composite
based on part key and hash algotiynm it stores data in partiton.

Local Sec indexes and global index
u sould ave passed part key
u can pass part key + prim sort key of other column

Local sec index=part key and prim key is on same column
and sort key is on other colmns

tables could not be renamed if u want to rename create new table and migrate data
create tables
