with advent of big data
u need nosqldb
fully managed cloud db
Seamless on-demand scaling
Unlimited COncurrent Read/write
Single digit millisecond latency
SUb-microsecond latency with DAX

DYnamo db is is serverless,  available on cloud,nosql(db which has big data(huge in volume,veloceity and veriety, high throughput)
Fast,flexible(structure and unstructure db),cost effective(pay for what u use),highly scalable,fault tolerant,secure.

Demo ENv Setup
1)setup AWS API user
IAM
Aws console not required only programmatic access-->Adminaccess,Dynamodbfull access-->save cred
windows on local-->env varibales-->+ varibale-->for acces ke id and key value and region
install nodejs on windows on cme node --version
browser nodejs from browser LTS
node --version
got to vscode the zip file pat u downloaded test.zip
terminal-->npm install aws-sdk
node list-table.js


Data Normalization
why :- to efficeintly organize data,eliminate redundant data

Normilization forms
1)1NF:- elimante repeating groups
2)2NF:- elimante redundant data,
3)3NF:-elimate columns that are not dependent on kry

Also this leads to more able creation and since more table created more operations and more compute power is required,so rdbms db doesn't solve this issue if data is huge
so Nosql db.

AS rdbms db:- not suited for unstrucutred data and big data

**Basics of Nosql db

Dynamodb(Serverless,Nosql,0-adminstration,u don't need any instalaalltion,strat using directly)
Items(row) attribut(columns)
in json format
Primke is comluslory
has local sec index
global sec index

tables are top level entities
use some prefix to nam tables (test.users, test_projects)
2 regions can have tables with same name.

Data types
Scalar:- string(only non-empty values),number,boolean,binary (exactly one value)
set typles:- multiple scalar values (string set,number set,binary set, repated value not allowed in set)
Document typez:_list and map(complex structure)


Dynamo db charges on RCU and WCU
Dynamo db consisitency model.
strong read conssitency
eventual vnsistenyc :- u may get stale data(by default mode)
eventual consistency is cheaper.

RCU
1 RCU = 1 strong read consistency read/sec
1RCU = 2 eventual consistency read/sec
for 4 kb of data.

1wCU= 1 write 
RCU:- 4KB of data 1 RCU, 1 strong read consitency and with eveuntaul consistency u require 0.5 RCU
WCU:- 1KB of data 1 WCU, ! write per second

eg:-
avg item size is=10kb.
provicioned capacity=10RCU and 10WCU
so strong consistency read=4kb*10=40KB/sec.
eventual consitency=2(4kb*10)=80KB/sec.
write throughput=1kb*10 KB=10KB

eg2:- to find RCU's to read 10KB of data per sec with strong consistency= 10KB/4KB=2.5(so rounding up to 3 RCSU)
for eventual consitency=3RCU's *0.5=1.5 RCU's
Scaling of capacity can happen 4 times in a day.



DYnamo db stores data in partitions
1 partition=10gb o data
1 partiton=1000wcu or 3000rcu
table can have 1 or more partitions

when u create a table it will provison partiton based on provisone capacity
eg:- 500 RCU's and 500 wcu

number of partitons=(500 rcu/3000 + 500/1000wcu)=0.67 which is 1 Pariton
if run out of memory it will allocate more part

Index:_
1 Mand prim key=either simple or composite
based on part key and hash algotiynm it stores data in partiton.

Local Sec indexes and global index
u sould ave passed part key
u can pass part key + prim sort key of other column

Local sec index=part key and prim key is on same column
and sort key is on other colmns

tables could not be renamed if u want to rename create new table and migrate data
create tables


****************88null values in dynamo db
commandline table creaion
updation.


1)setup global tables pool( the participating tables needs to be empty)
global_td_notes
prim user_id as string, timestamp as sort key
uncheck the default settings ad create local sec index prim user_id sort key title
global sec index note_id sring
disable autoscaling for now
rcu 1 wcu 1
create
go to global tables tab also enable steams old and new this is prereq
goto global tabels again and ad region 

2)Autoscaling
3)streams for data archiving



On demand backup of table.
doesn't effect table performance, auto encrypted.
can only restore it to same region.
restore to a new table.
lambda function to create a periodic backup like cron.
DAta pipleines..supported for few regions can be used to export and import data from dynamodb to s3 and from s3 to dynamodb

if u don't want to use aws datapilines then u can use
aws dynamodb scan --table-name SourceTable --region ap-south-1 --output json > output.json

aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://output.json --region us-east-1

or use lambda
